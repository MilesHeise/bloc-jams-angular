# Bloc-Jams Angular

A spotify-type app used as practice learning Angular. Re-built my previous multi-page Bloc-Jams app from the ground up. Now it works as a single page application using the Angular framework. 

## Trying it out

Presumably anyone who would have reason to be exploring my project already has NodeJS and NPM installed, in which case once you pull down this project you can run it with the basic `npm start` command and explore it. At some point when I have time I will upload a Netlify or Heroku version and link it here. If you need to see this project and NPM doesn't work for you, let me know and I can hurry the deployed version.
